                <p>As a student at SF State, Monte attended over a couple dozen hackathons working with a <a href="https://github.com/Monte9?tab=repositories" target="_blank" style="text-decoration: underline">variety of technologies for mobile and web development</a> such as rails, express, swift, java, parse, firebase and mongoDB to name a few.

                <br>
                <p>During his senior year in college, Monte started MobileSpace to <a href="../blog/Getting-ready-to-launch-MobileSpace" style="text-decoration: underline" target="_blank">help teach iOS development to students as the CS program at SF State lacked any such course.</a>
