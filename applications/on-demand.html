                <p>Last meetup session took place in Fall 2016 and had over 15 members.
                    There was a meetup every weekend over the course of 3 months.
                    In the end, 6 members successfully completed the iOS MobileSpace cirriculum and have gone on to work as full-time iOS Software Engineers.
                    You can read more about the last meetup session on the MobileSpace Blog <a href="../blog/Phase-1-successful" style="text-decoration: underline">here</a>.</p>
