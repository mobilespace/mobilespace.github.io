#### Let this be the first thing you hear from me.. I am not the smartest software engineer you will meet. With that being said, I am certain that I can teach you a thing or two about software engineering. What I have come to understand is that you don't need to be the smartest (in a specific subject or in general) person in the room to feel worthy of sharing knowledge, but in-fact you just need to figure out if someone else values what you know and if so, are they interested in learning it from you?

#### When I first taught myself how to build a simple to-do list app for iOS just over a year ago, it was not a fun process as I struggled to piece together various links and resources that I found on the internet. Fast-forward 8 months.. I graduated from CodePath University's free iOS Bootcamp in San Francisco which gave me a solid foundation in iOS Development and enabled me to work on more challenging and exciting app ideas on my own. In hindsight, I believe that the most exciting way to learn iOS development is face-to-face with someone who already knows what they are talking about. This for two main reasons: 1. Beginners errors can be extremely easy to fix in the presence of someone experienced in turn accelerating the learning process and 2. Speaking with an experienced developer helps the student scope out their ideas and projects accurately.

#### Keeping the above things in mind, let me introduce to you... MobileSpace: a weekly meetup in San Francisco to enable developers to build their own mobile apps with an excellent in-person community to teach and help accelerate your project to completion.

#### Over the past few months, some of my friends have proposed that we collaborate to build *xyz*  iOS app together and few others have expressed interest in learning how to build iOS apps. Also most recently, I have found myself to be getting involved in many more projects with very time commitment to each. Hence I figured that I should start a mobile development meetup every weekend where anyone that is either interested to learn/collab on iOS apps shows up and we can build a community of developers that are willing to set aside a few hours each weekend to work on learning and teaching mobile development. So that's the origin of MobileSpace.

#### This past week, I setup the website for MobileSpace and created an application process wherein anyone interested to join the community can apply. In the upcoming week, I will be working on reaching out to students in San Francisco (SF State specifically) to see if I can spark some interest among students to joining the MobileSpace community.

#### This blog post marks the official launch of MobileSpace and I am excited to see where it will end up.
