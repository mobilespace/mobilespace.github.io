## I attended CodePath univ and it empowered me to do so much more in iOS.

## This fall semester, I wanted to commit more time to develooing iOS app and working on my projects. One of the easiest ways I figured was to start a public meetup so that I would be pressured to show up each weekend.

## Also I got coffee with Kylie and she expressed interest in learning iOS edvelopemnet. Hence I figure there might be many more people out there that would be interested to learn as well.

## I want to give back. I enjoy teaching. I attended OS HAck and I taight a team of 4 how ot build a iOS app in 24 hrs. WE build Trump Or False and it was a lot of fun. At the end of it, the learnt how to build an iOS app.

## I want to start something and fail at it. Learn what is takes to build something and see the time commitment it takes to do it right.

## Spent the last week setting up the website. Now that I have online presence, I can spread the work on the ground.

## Need to do outreach in SFSU Classess and ask them to apply online.

## Here we go. Even if nobody shows up, it will give me a reason to work on my projects every weekend just like a regular class on schedule.
